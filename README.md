# Mileage/Location Tracking

# Overview: All businesses require records of their mileage and time spent anytime they travel to an offsite location. With our Mileage/Location Tracking mobile app any employee will have the ability to track the miles they travel for business record purposes. 

# Our app will allow the user to have their starting and ending location tracked as well as the distance they travel. Thus, they will be able to accurately record their mileage as well as hours. Additionally, the app will create easily digested reports weekly. We conclude that this mobile app will be used by small business employees and owners for the sake of keeping records regarding mileage.
